# BUS5001-NotebookLM

A part of LaTrobe's Master of Business Analytics, an exploration into Cloud Based Technology was required.

This is a repository of my exploration into Notebook LM.

Lecture slide content from BUS5001 (weeks 1-11) were uploaded to NotebookLM. The following functionality was tested:
-	Enhanced note summaries
-	Contextual question answering
-	Study guides
-	Podcast generation
